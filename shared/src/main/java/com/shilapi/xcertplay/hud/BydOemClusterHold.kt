 * How OsnPlay keeps the car's own map off the instrument-cluster surface while it mirrors there.
 *
 * On DiLink 4.0 the car draws its cluster map with a single activity
 * ([BydOemClusterNavi.STOCK_MAP_CLUSTER_ACTIVITY]), so disabling just that activity stops the
 * projection while the rest of the app — and, on some firmware, the cluster's own navigation mode —
 * keeps running. Disabling the whole package is blunter and takes the app's other services with it,
 * which is why the driver picks here instead of the app deciding. Needs ADB over network.
