# Unreleased

- Save diagnostic reports privately in OsnPlay when the head unit has no document picker or working Downloads provider, with explicit Share and selectable View report actions. This unblocks collecting logs for #135; its CarPlay startup failure still needs a device report.

# OsnPlay 0.2.11 — 2026-10-03

- Add preferred Wi-Fi Direct channel selection for the next connection; Auto remains the default, and manual channel rejection/mismatch reports an error (#175).
- Add a movable custom dashboard turn card with 2% position steps; leave unknown arrows blank and clear expired guidance (#155).
- Offer two-, three- or four-finger settings swipes, keeping three as the default (#156).
- Add opt-in read-only legacy vehicle-data detection while preserving default DiLink 5.0 mode; reject unaccepted/stale probe publication and fix accepted-battery lock ordering (#158, integrated through #173).
- Keep wireless location/vehicle data on its runtime Wi-Fi link and defer parked-video decisions until SETUP/event readiness (#157).
- Add optional automatic car-hotspot startup, off by default, with verified own-package authorization and unified vehicle settings (#164/#173).
- Support Android TV/remote controls while preserving head-unit touchscreen Back and absolute knob X/Y; keep its workflow source-only (#146).
- Retain artists across partial title updates and publish song metadata/artwork only when changed (#161, #162).
- Correct Android 9 audio API use, release failed codecs, reconnect with settled geometry/readiness, and require own-app VPN scope (#168 and local corrections).
- Add one guarded Auto-mode API 29 P2P recovery for the exact reported pre-create Builder error, plus bounded wireless/media/theme/own-app-exit diagnostics without payload recording or automatic uploads.

See [0.2.11 release notes](docs/RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.11.md) for requirements, device-test limits and fresh-report guidance. Preferred channel selection does not establish stutter as fixed; Qin Plus, Siri, iOS 15 and day/night reports remain under investigation. Android 9 is still the minimum; Wi-Fi Direct needs Android 10+.

# OsnPlay 0.2.10 — 2026-10-03

- Publish CarPlay song metadata, position and artwork to Android media sessions; bound artwork queues and reject stale work across sessions (#82).
- Preserve normal USBMUX frames while handling narrowly validated handshake padding (#114); let USB connect without saved wireless-hotspot credentials (#130).
- Handle unknown reported Wi-Fi Direct security types, retry busy channels and allow bounded 5 GHz fallback (#121).
- Select an available AirPlay port and advertise it over Bonjour and wired/wireless iAP2; close sockets on failed setup/notification (#143).
- Enable available platform echo cancellation and noise suppression for calls, restoring the previous mode afterward (#116).
- Detect BYD CAN/CANFD battery protocols and clear unsupported/stale readings (#123).
- Add a saved show/hide setting for the home-screen dashboard-map mirror (#133).
- Improve optional parked video with seeking and ten-second skip controls; validate media URLs and redirects (#129).
- Extend Ukrainian translations, including the new map-mirror setting (#128 and release localization).
- Add bounded anonymous Bluetooth/USB/boot and microphone capture/encode/send diagnostics to exported reports; omit audio and packet contents.

See [0.2.10 release notes](docs/RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.10.md) for contributor credits, requirements and validation limits. Android 9 remains the minimum supported version.

# OsnPlay 0.2.9 — 2026-10-02

- Follow BYD head-unit day/night changes while CarPlay is visible, including firmware that does not reliably deliver Android configuration callbacks.
- Restore media and navigation audio stream selection to 0–20 and inherit older saved navigation settings when no new selection exists. Vendor-specific outputs depend on head-unit support.
- Keep CarPlay connected through normal surround-view window changes, preserving video proportions and touch alignment. A connection started in a narrow camera window reconnects once when the window grows to restore the full-screen canvas.
- Add Ukrainian to the app language picker, Android app-language settings, and website. Correct its audio help to describe streams 1–20.
- Add an optional CarPlay song title, artist, and play/pause display on the BYD instrument cluster, using the existing network ADB connection.
- Add a CarPlay navigation widget for launchers that host standard Android widgets, with the next turn, road, distance, arrival information, and song. Clear expired guidance and explicitly cleared song titles.
- Add an optional floating copy of the dashboard map on the centre screen, with drag, pinch-to-resize, and tap-to-open controls. Requires permission to draw over other apps; Usage Access restricts it to home screens.
- Fix floating-map resizing on head units that ignore small pinch gestures.
- Let compatible launchers embed the live dashboard map on Android 11 and newer. Sharing is off by default; turning it off closes existing shared map views.
- Add map-host and OsnPlay Home sample apps for developers. OsnPlay Home combines the live map, standard Android widgets, a clock, and an app list; sample builds, lint, and Home back-navigation tests are checked in CI.
- Leave the GPS course empty when its direction is unknown, instead of reporting north. Valid GPS directions are preserved.

# OsnPlay 0.2.8 — 2026-09-30

- Keep iPhone location reporting active across the wireless Bluetooth-to-Wi-Fi CarPlay handoff; limit location updates to one per second on wireless and USB.
- Add optional ADB wheel-speed and gear reporting for iPhone dead reckoning when GPS is unavailable. Tunnel use has not yet been verified.
- Add optional iOS 27 video playback on the car screen while parked, with iPhone, touchscreen and steering-wheel controls; close playback when leaving P.
- Explain unsupported DRM-protected video such as Apple TV+, which requires a licensed FairPlay receiver.
- Improve playback error reporting and preserve CarPlay when the head unit cannot play a video.

# OsnPlay 0.2.7 — 2026-09-29

- App interface in English, Simplified Chinese, Arabic, Russian and Spanish; synchronized Android app-language settings.
- Steering-wheel media controls and long-press Siri on supported BYD firmware while CarPlay is on screen.
- Dashboard display choices: map, turn card, or both; corrected dashboard keyframe recovery.
- Optional ADB feature on supported DiLink 5.0: pause the dashboard map stream when its display mode hides the map.
- Optional ADB battery reporting for Apple Maps, with warning threshold, charging-connector selection and a checked reconnect action.
- Audio playback reliability fixes and clearer dashboard settings.
- Clarify the BYD-only support scope on the README and all five website editions.

# 0.2.0 — BYD navigation and connection improvements

- Standalone windshield HUD arrows, distance and street names on the verified DiLink5.1 firmware; no ADB, root or computer helper.
- Retain contributor cluster/SOME-IP navigation, route parsing, BYD CarPlay icon and display-size presets.
- Fix Car hotspot startup by using scoped IPv6 when available and binding discovery/probing to the AP interface. Physically confirmed on the development car.
- Drain asynchronously decoded audio during packet gaps and rebuild the music buffer after starvation. Wi-Fi Direct is much better in the user retest; occasional audio cutouts remain for a later version.
- Preserve bounded music-buffer choices, USB read improvements and decoder recovery; fix USB request/close races and keep vendor output outside phone callbacks.
- Save audio/video/receive timing and discovery diagnostics without road names or protocol payloads.
- HUD cleanup on normal end/disconnect/off/stale input; interrupted sessions recover on the next app launch. Force-stop may leave guidance visible until reopening.
- Thanks to @romanchukg-cloud and @georgiyrr for PR #3 and vehicle testing.

# 0.1.0 release restored — 2026-09-25

- Rebuilt and signed the APK locally with explicitly supplied runtime authentication assets.
- Restored release downloads; no app behavior or version-code change from 0.1.0.
- Accessory identity remains in the APK only. No credential files enter Git or the source archive.
- Retained generated test identities and public-source credential checks.
- Source/CI builds omit runtime identity assets by default; local packaging requires an explicit external directory.

# Source reset — 2026-09-25

- Withdrew the 0.1.0 APK and removed its release tag.
- Reset the public branch after preserving restricted local incident records.
- Removed static synthetic test private keys; generate test identities at runtime.
- Removed automatic private-asset packaging and disabled the old release build script.
- Added a build guard rejecting credential asset files.
- Replaced the download site with a five-language suspension notice.

The APK was subsequently rebuilt and restored as described above. Existing copies cannot be recalled by a Git history reset.
